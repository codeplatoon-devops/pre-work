# DevOps Course Pre-Work

> @BenjaminCohen here. I'm going to use these 'asides' to add comments.

> My main goals for this document are: 
> 1) We want to set clear expectations about what the pre-work is and what is expected in terms of effort and what passing means *precisely* and
> 2) Everything we expect them to learn and that we link to as an external learning resource has to have some kind of complementary quiz to test the material. I don't think it will be useful to the instructors or the students to throw a bunch of links at them that we never test them on, as the students will likely not engage with it deeply, and as an instructor we cannot actually expect that knowledge has already been absorbed.

## 📜 Course Description

Congratulations on your acceptance into Code Platoon - we are excited to have you! To best prepare you for the rigors of DevOps engineering and our immersive bootcamp, we have created a pre-work program. This document will outline all the things you need to do in order to show up prepared for the first day. Please read through it carefully and let us know if you have any questions.

## 📚 Expectations

Code Platoon’s mission is to train military veterans and their spouses into professional DevOps engineers. The traditional approach to becoming a DevOps engineer usually begins with graduating from a 4 year university program in computer science and then working as a backend engineer for a few years. We’re trying to teach you the necessary skills in 4 months. As such, we are not going to be able to go into nearly as much background material as a traditional degree and our course will focus much more on the practical tools of the trade. The DevOps industry ultimately cares about one thing: “Can you deploy this codebase?” As a result, our course will be oriented around teaching you the skills necessary to accomplish this task in the timeframe we have available to us.

### Our Mission

We want to be very clear from the beginning: 

The success of Code Platoon is directly correlated with our alumni’s success. We do not wish to see any student fail. As such, we expect you to complete a set of pre-work to prove to us you are ready to participate in the full time program.

We expect you to both be responsive and organized in communicating with Code Platoon and to complete a course of pre-work material on your own to prove to us you possess a solid foundation of knowledge and self-reliance we can build upon in the full time course.

### Responsiveness and organization

* Be responsive on [Slack](https://slack.com/) and via email. Slack is our preferred form of communication so [download](https://slack.com/downloads) it on your computer and/or on your phone. Use it to communicate with each other separately, not just for ‘public’ announcements.

* Dedicate at least 10-15 hours a week for the next 4 weeks to accomplishing the pre-work material.

* There will be a few check-in meetings, such as:
  - *Mandatory* Group Intro Call
  - *Mandatory* Group Check-in call (half way through the pre-work) 
  - *Optional* Group Office Hours (1 hour, we will be available to answer any questions)

### Pre-work requirements

* Pass the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Exam and share the results with us.
* Solve all of our Python programming challenges on CoderByte.
* Pass the Final Live Technical Assessment.

> By the time this is finalized we will want concrete details including how they should share their certification status with us.

#### Structure 
Each week of the pre-work, you will be expected to watch the online tutorials we suggest, attend a group video conference, and solve programming challenges on CoderByte. Additionally, over the full course of the pre-work you will be expected to complete the AWS SkillBuilder Cloud Practitioner course in preparation for the certification exam.

> @BenjaminCohen we need to work on the wording of this document given that we don't have weekly challenges, but rather there is only a single week with all the CoderByte challenges rolled together.

#### Grading
The requirements for getting into the full-time program are:
* Pass the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification exam
* Solve all of our Python programming challenges on CoderByte
* Pass the Final Live Technical Assessment

> We need to clarify what grading/passing looks like for our own pre-work.

#### CoderByte
The programming assignments can be found on CoderByte. CoderByte is a service that tests your Python coding knowledge. You can find the link to the coding challenges in the [Calendar](#calendar) section below.  

You don’t have to complete every challenge right away but please make sure you complete all the challenges by the end of the pre-work, and ideally pace yourself to complete the relevant challenges the week they are assigned. 

#### Repl.it
[Replit.com](http://replit.com) is a service that allows you to write and execute code in the browser. First, visit the site and create a new account, which is free. This is a great resource to help you practice your coding skills. *You can copy and paste the challenges from CoderByte into Repl.it and complete them and then submit the code on CoderByte*. Here is a [Replit tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zURQVKo0Th8).

#### Final Live Technical/Coding Assessment
Before you officially start Code Platoon, you need to pass our Technical Assessment. This will occur after Week 4 of the pre-work (or earlier if you think you’re ready). You will schedule to meet with one of our instructors remotely and they will give you a link to answer a set of multiple choice questions. Finally there will be a coding challenge to solve. Both of these assessments will happen in front of the instructor. This is to ensure that you are proficient enough to attend Code Platoon. 

#### Computer Requirements
For the Pre-Work you can do everything in any browser. 

## Calendar

This course has two types of learning material. The first is provided by AWS as an official course and certification to prove essential knowledge about the field of cloud computing and is not technically-oriented. The second will be provided by Code Platoon to add to this understanding with basic programming proficiency that we will expect you to walk in with day 1.

### Self-paced learning (AWS)

The goal of this section is for you to acquire an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, which is a non-technical certification that expects no pre-knowledge. You can learn more about the exam and schedule it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/).

To help you pass the certification exam we recommend two free resources provided directly from AWS. 

- An [official course](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/134/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials) that covers all the exam material
- An [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam preparation course](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/9449/exam-prep-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner) specifically designed to help you understand what to expect from the exam itself

### Weekly pre-work (Code Platoon)

> Chandra suggested the split in days below, but I don't know that this will work effectively, we likely want to simplify it by simply making 4 modules, each a week long.

> Chandra turned me onto [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0CiQ7bzwETXXnwbmvG5D7nXGHddArBP) playlist of pre-recorded Code Platoon branded videos on diff topics relevant to this intro work. I haven't watched them yet but it would be great to use our own resources when appropriate over external resources.

## Final Assessment

Final Live Technical and Coding Assessment (must be completed by Xth May, 2023)

> need to set exact date

### Intro Call
This intro call is to outline what’s expected over the next 4-6 weeks and to show you what resources you have at your disposal. An email will be sent out with the date and time of this Intro call and how to join. 

### Weekly Pre-Work Group Check-ins
It’s okay to be nervous and to not understand everything. We’re not here to leave you high and dry when things get tough. These check-ins will be about 1 hour long and will be conducted via Zoom or Google Meet. Bring all of your questions and concerns to these meetings and get support with the pre-work. It is also a way for your instructors to assess your progress, so come prepared to write code and answer questions.

### Group Office Hours 
We will be conducting two group meetings where the instructor(s) will answer any questions you have up until that point and also review a coding challenge to help you understand the thought process of a DevOps engineer. 

### Contact Us
The best way to reach us is via Slack @chandradeoarya or @BenjaminCohen or you can also email us at chandra@codeplatoon.org or benjamin@codeplatoon.org
