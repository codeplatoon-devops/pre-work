# DevOps Course Pre-Work

## 📜 Course Description

Congratulations on your acceptance into Code Platoon - we are excited to have you! This pre-work program was created to best prepare you for the rigors of our immersive bootcamp and ultimately for a professional role as a DevOps engineer. This document will outline all the things you need to do in order to show up prepared on the first day. Please read through it carefully and let us know if you have any questions.

## 📚 Expectations

Code Platoon’s mission is to train military veterans and their spouses into professional DevOps engineers. The traditional approach to becoming a DevOps engineer usually begins with graduating from a 4 year university program in computer science and then working as a backend engineer for a few years. We’re trying to teach you the necessary skills in 4 months. As such, we are not going to be able to go into nearly as much background material as a traditional degree and our course will focus much more on the practical tools of the trade. The DevOps industry ultimately cares about one thing: “Can you deploy this codebase?” As a result, our course will be oriented around teaching you the skills necessary to accomplish this task in the timeframe we have available to us.

### Our Mission

The success of Code Platoon is directly correlated with our alumni’s success. We do not wish to see any student fail. As such, we expect you to complete a set of pre-work to prove to us you are ready to participate in the full time program.

We expect you to both be responsive and organized in communicating with Code Platoon and to complete a course of pre-work material on your own to prove to us you possess a solid foundation of knowledge and self-reliance we can build upon in the full time course.

### Responsiveness and organization

* Be responsive on [Slack](https://slack.com/) and via email. Slack is our preferred form of communication so [download](https://slack.com/downloads) it on your computer and/or on your phone. Use it to communicate with each other separately, not just for ‘public’ announcements.

* Dedicate at least 10-15 hours a week for the next 4 weeks to accomplishing the pre-work material.

* There will be a few check-in meetings, such as:
  - *Mandatory* Group Intro Call
  - *Mandatory* Group Check-in call (half way through the pre-work) 
  - *Optional* Group Office Hours (1 hour weekly, we will be available to answer any questions)

### Pre-work requirements

* Pass the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Exam and share the results with us.
* Solve all of our Python programming challenges on CoderByte.
* Pass the Final Live Technical Assessment.

> By the time this is finalized we will want concrete details including how they should share their certification status with us.

#### Structure 
For pre-work you will be expected to watch the online tutorials we suggest, attend weekly group video conferences, and solve programming challenges on CoderByte. Additionally, over the full course of the pre-work you will be expected to complete the AWS SkillBuilder Cloud Practitioner course in preparation for the certification exam.

#### Grading
The requirements for getting into the full-time program are:
* Pass the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification exam
* Solve all of our Python programming challenges on CoderByte
* Pass the final Live Technical Assessment

#### CoderByte
The pre-work includes some programming assignments you can complete on CoderByte. CoderByte is a service that tests your Python coding knowledge.
> Note to applicants: the CoderByte challenges are going to default to JavaScript as a language but there is a dropdown to select the language of your choice. Choose Python3.

#### Repl.it
[Replit.com](http://replit.com) is a service that allows you to write and execute code in the browser. First, visit the site and create a new account, which is free. This is a great resource to help you practice your coding skills. You can (and should) copy and paste the challenges from CoderByte into Repl.it so you can see your code running in real time and experiment, and when you feel ready you can submit the code on CoderByte*. Here is a [Replit tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zURQVKo0Th8).

#### Final Live Technical/Coding Assessment
Before you officially start Code Platoon, you need to pass our Technical Assessment. This will occur after Week 4 of the pre-work (or earlier if you think you’re ready). You will schedule to meet with one of our instructors remotely and they will give you a link to answer a set of multiple choice questions. Finally there will be a coding challenge to solve. Both of these assessments will happen in front of the instructor. This is to ensure that you are proficient enough to attend Code Platoon.

#### Computer Requirements
For the Pre-Work you can do everything in any browser.

## 🗓 Calendar

This course has two types of learning material. The first is provided by AWS as an official course and certification to prove essential knowledge about the field of cloud computing and is not technically-oriented (i.e. no programming background required). The second will be provided by Code Platoon to add to this understanding with basic programming proficiency that we will expect you to walk in with day 1.

### AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification

In order to complete the pre-work you will be required to acquire an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, which is a non-technical certification that expects no pre-knowledge but will get you up to speed on AWS as a platform. You can learn more about the exam and schedule it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/).

To help you prepare for the certification exam we strongly recommend you take the official AWS SkillBuilder course [AWS Cloud Practioner Essentials](ttps://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/134/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials). We will be assigning modules (which include videos and short multiple choice quizzes) from this course as part of the pre-work with your ultimate goal being to pass the certification exam.

## 👨‍💻 Final Assessment

Final Live Technical and Coding Assessment (must be completed by April 10, 2023)

### Intro Call
This intro call is to outline what’s expected over the next 4-6 weeks and to show you what resources you have at your disposal. An email will be sent out with the date and time of this Intro call and how to join. 

### Weekly Pre-Work Group Check-ins
It’s okay to be nervous and to not understand everything. We’re not here to leave you high and dry when things get tough. These check-ins will be about 1 hour long and will be conducted via Zoom or Google Meet. Bring all of your questions and concerns to these meetings and get support with the pre-work. It is also a way for your instructors to assess your progress, so come prepared to write code and answer questions.

### Group Office Hours 
We will be conducting two group meetings where the instructors will answer any questions you have up until that point and also review a coding challenge to help you understand the thought process of a DevOps engineer. 

### Contact Us
The best way to reach us is via Slack @chandradeoarya or @BenjaminCohen or you can also email us at chandra@codeplatoon.org or benjamin@codeplatoon.org
