# Recent Updates
- I removed the existing 'web app infrastructure' videos because they are too high level for a beginner and replaced them with a simpler video on the concept of a server.
> In my opinion our biggest obstacle in the pre-work is covering 'web app architecture' beyond the basics of the internet. This is honestly a sign to me of why this course is likely to fail students, as this single item of pre-work is an attempt to replace the majority of the main software development course, and knowing how a web app works in a fair bit of detail is basically required contextual knowledge for a DevOps engineer to understand where they fit into the picture, and it's not easily replaced with a short video.

# Schedule Details
- missing calendar dates for the intro/check-ins/office hours
- missing details on how to take the live assessment
- I put the date the course starts for the final date to take the live technical assessment but we really need to pin all dates down ASAP.

# Calendar
- Are we testing them enough on Python? We only have one section for this, 3 CoderByte problems. By comparison the main program has a unique programming assessment every week.

# Live Assessment
- what will this be? 
- I am assuming we oursleves will create the multiple choice exam, and it will be Python programming + git/github oriented, as the AWS exam will be multiple choice and cover the cloud computing portion for us.
